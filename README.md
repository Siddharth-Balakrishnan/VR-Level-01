"VR Level ONE" is an innovative virtual reality (VR) project designed to detect and evaluate the onset of motion sickness and other discomforts associated with first-time VR usage. 
The primary objective of this project is to create a safe and controlled environment that simulates real-world physics and various interactive scenarios to assess the user's physical and psychological response to VR exposure. 
Through real-time monitoring and advanced analytics, "VR Level ONE" identifies symptoms of motion sickness, such as nausea, dizziness, and disorientation, enabling timely intervention and personalized adjustments. 
This project aims to enhance user experience and safety, paving the way for broader adoption of VR technology in diverse applications.
